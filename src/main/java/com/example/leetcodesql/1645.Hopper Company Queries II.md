题目解读：本题想要计算的是2020年每个月活跃司机的占比。活跃司机是指当月至少accept一次ride的司机。总司机数量是指截止计算月份，所有加入的司机的cumsum
思路：需要注意的是drivers表和rides表提供的都是记录数据，是间断的，而result要的是从1-12的连续数据。
1）所以第一步可以利用with recursive构建一列1-12月的month临时表。
2）1-12月的活跃司机数量，可以通过将month表left join 每个月活跃司机的数量，未关联上的null即为0个活跃司机数量。活跃司机的数量通过rides和acceptrides关联，根据month分组，利用count(distinct driver_id)计算得到，注意对司机id需要去重
3）总司机数量可以利用窗口函数sum over（order by date)累加得到，但注意需要先和month表join，得到空缺月份的新增司机数量为0，再进行累加

```roomsql
with recursive tn as 
(select 1 as n 
union all
select n+1 from tn where n<12)

select
   month,

   round(ifnull(num2/num1*100,0),2) as working_percentage
from
(
select
   t1.month,
   ifnull(sum(num1) over(order by month),0) as num1,
   ifnull(num2,0) as num2  
from
(
(select 0 as month,(select count(*) from drivers where join_date <'2020-1-1') as num1)
union all
(
   select 
       tn.n as month,
       count(driver_id) as num1
   from tn left join drivers d 
   on tn.n = month(d.join_date) and year(d.join_date) = 2020
   group by tn.n
)) t1
left join 
(
   select
       month(requested_at) as month,
       count(distinct driver_id) as num2
   from rides r left join acceptedrides a on r.ride_id = a.ride_id
   where year(requested_at) = 2020
   group by month(requested_at)
) t2 on t1.month = t2.month) t3
where month > 0
